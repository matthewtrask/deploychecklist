        <p>This is aimed at helping developers new to deployment have a more successful deployment of code. Deploying can honestly be scary, and I hope this checkbox helps allievate the feeling. In this list you will find things that you might already do, things you didnt know you should do, and things to do should it go wrong. This can work if you are a team of two, or a team of 20, as long as you follow this list.</p>
        
        <h3>Pre Deploy</h3>
        <p>Prior to deployment, what you should be looking for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All PR's have been squashed to a single commit</li>
          <li>Code has been reviewed by various team mates</li>
          <li>Code was committed with tests to ensure the quality of code</li>
          <li>Continious Integration has run <em>and</em> passed. (Travis, CircleCI, CodeShip, Jenkins)</li>
          <li>PR has noted any changes to the database, migrations that need to be run, or places in the code base affected by the PR.</li>
        </ul>
